# 1.6 Gentoo - Desktop Managers

## Overview

I've bundled together all the notes on setting up Desktop Environments here

## LXDE

The default desktop is lxde for the rpi

    emerge lxde-meta
    rc-update add dbus default

## Gnome

I've put some notes here on installing Gnome onto the Rpi2,
again I'm not a big fan of gtk personally but it's used by mono
and I just wanted to try it out

As a first step I'd recomend installing systemd
this doesn't mean you have to boot using it, but it is a depend for Gnome

Next I had to make the following use changes to /etc/portage/package.use

    dev-libs/openssl -bindist
    net-misc/openssh -bindist

I didn't want to disable bindist globally
(bindist means use binary packages where you can instead of compiling source).
But one of the Gnome depends, requires openssl be installed with -bindist.
Also openssh needs to have the same bindist setting as openssl

If you try to emerge gnome for the first time you'll probably get a list of use flags
and package unmasks it's asking for as part of the install

Any other use flags it asked for I just enabled globally using ufed.
For unmasking I just used --autounmask-write and etc-update to unmask the Gnome packages that were needed.
Also I'd recomend installing from within a tmux session if doing this over ssh so you can leave it unattended.
and to make sure your existing world packages are already up to date first, just to avoid complications

    emerge gnome

Note it takes a little while to start up so it's best to be patient.

## KDE

This one might be a bit heavy for the rpi,
but I wanted to experiment with different desktops, and I wanted the Qt libs

* [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE/Plasma_5_upgrade](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE/Plasma_5_upgrade)
* [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE/Overlay](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE/Overlay)
* [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE)

Since I want to use the latest plasma 5.2 lets add in the kde overlay

    layman -f -a kde

Next unmask the kde plasma ebuilds

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.unmask
    cd /etc/portage/package.unmask
    ln -s /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation/package.unmask/kde-plasma-5.2

Next time to change some keywords <br />
Note I already had a file setup under /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
so I had to relocate this to cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/autounmask.keywords

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    ln -s /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-frameworks-5.7.keywords
    ln -s /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-plasma-5.2.keywords 

Lets disable the upower use flag for sddm if systemd is enabled

    nano -w /etc/portage/package.use
    x11-misc/sddm -upower

Note when unmasking package names try to make sure the version number is 5.2.9999 instead of 9999
for packages under the group kde-plasma.
For kde 4 the kde-meta package name would be used, but for plasma we use instead

    emerge --ask @kde-plasma

I've also found there seems to be some issues with finding the git repo for kde-plasma/libmm-qt
I couldn't find the repo on the kde site so it's possible that it's no longer needed

Another thing to watch out for is that I had to unmask the egl use flag
And enable egl for clutter to get it to build without conflicts

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
    echo "-egl" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask

After installing everything, I noticed that a single file was missing for startx
/etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

Let's create a new file

    nano -w /etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

Add 2 lines of text to it

    #!/bin/sh
    exec "/usr/bin/startkde"

make it executable

    chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

At this point we should now be able to select it via XSESSION=KDE-5 (see below)

## MayNard

Looking at this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/preview-the-upcoming-maynard-desktop/) <br />
In order to get an accelerated desktop ideally we need to use wayland
However the default desktop the rpi uses LXDE doesn't currently support wayland

One option is kde or gnome, but they're a bit heavyweight for the Pi <br />
Raspian has been working on something called Maynard as an alternative for use with Wayland

It looks as if there's an overlay setup for it already under leio

* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard](http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard)

    layman -a leio

Lets install

    emerge wayland
    emerge maynard

In some cases the gles or gles2 use flags are required when wayland is enabled.
Since gles (opengl es) is a subset of opengl designed for embedded systems
I'd recomend only enabling gles / gles2 only on the packages that need it enabled to compile
Otherwise you may get conflicts later on with packages within kde plasma for example


TODO 

 * Missing entry under /etc/X11/Sessions/
 * Maynard requires a background from kde-wallpapers, which does not seem
 * to be even provided anymore. Set the BACKGROUND environment variable
 * to point to a background image that exists, in order to be able to
 * launch Maynard for now.

## Misc

### Default Window Manager

In order to choose the default X window manager we need to edit a file.
For example to set to lxde

    nano -w /etc/env.d/90xsession
    
    XSESSION=lxde

    env-update && source /etc/profile

To get a list of the available values we can put there:

    cd /etc/X11/Sessions/
    ls -l

Then to start up X

    startx

It's important to run env-update and source /etc/profile after changing the value in the file
In order for the default value to be used to change

### XRDP

XRdp is usefull for when we want to connect to the Desktop via rdp from the outside

    make sure server use flag is enabled
    
    emerge --autounmask-write xrdp
    etc-update
    emerge xrdp

TODO Check setup with Wayland etc

### 3D Acceleration

TODO

enable egl / gles / gles1 / gles2 / gles3
disable opengl global

TODO make sure to remerge these:

    net-libs/webkit-gtk
    kde-frameworks/plasma
    kde-plasma/kwin

3D OpenGL ES

 * libEGL.so
 * libGLESv1_CM.so
 * libGLESv2.so
