# 1.6 Gentoo - Desktop Managers

## Overview

I've bundled together all the notes on setting up Desktop Environments here

## LXDE

The default desktop is lxde for the rpi

    emerge lxde-meta
    rc-update add dbus default

* [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXDE](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXDE)

## Gnome

I've put some notes here on installing Gnome onto the Rpi2,
again I'm not a big fan of gtk personally but it's used by mono
and I just wanted to try it out

As a first step I'd recomend installing systemd
this doesn't mean you have to boot using it, but it is a depend for Gnome

### Cairo use flag

Generally I wanted to avoid enabling opengl use flags since the rpi2's hardware drivers are opengles
But I needed to enable it for cairo

    echo ">=x11-libs/cairo-1.14.2 opengl" >>/etc/portage/package.use

### OpenSSL / OpehSSH use flags

Next I had to make the following use changes to /etc/portage/package.use

    dev-libs/openssl -bindist
    net-misc/openssh -bindist

I didn't want to disable bindist globally
(bindist means use binary packages where you can instead of compiling source).
But one of the Gnome depends, requires openssl be installed with -bindist.
Also openssh needs to have the same bindist setting as openssl









### TODO

upload example files




If you try to emerge gnome for the first time you'll probably get a list of use flags
and package unmasks it's asking for as part of the install

Any other use flags it asked for I just enabled globally using ufed.
For unmasking I just used --autounmask-write and etc-update to unmask the Gnome packages that were needed.
Also I'd recomend installing from within a tmux session if doing this over ssh so you can leave it unattended.
and to make sure your existing world packages are already up to date first, just to avoid complications

    emerge gnome

Note it takes a little while to start up so it's best to be patient.

## KDE

This one might be a bit heavy for the rpi,
but I wanted to experiment with different desktops, and I wanted the Qt libs

### Fix for sddm / upower

Lets disable the upower use flag for sddm if systemd is enabled

    echo "x11-misc/sddm -upower" >>/etc/portage/package.use

### Unmask the Qt5 use flag
    
    mkdir /etc/portage/profile
    echo "-qt5" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask

Then make sure to add qt5 to your use flags within /etc/portage/make.conf

### Unmask some packages

First we're going to get a list of the packages we're going to unmask

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    emerge -pv plasma-meta

copy and paste the section that lists which packages to unmask into a file
called /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/kde-plasma.keywords

Then just emerge as normal

    emerge plasma-meta



### TODO Remove the below


### Unmask some packages

Next it's time to unmask some packages
First we're going to copy some files out of the overlay, the reason for copying is that we'll need to alter these files
the keywords are only setup by amd64 by default and we're using arm here

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/
    cp /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-frameworks-5.11.keywords kde-frameworks-5.11.keywords
    cp /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-plasma-5.3.keywords kde-plasma-5.3.keywords
    
Next go into both keyword files and add a space followed by 2 stars to the end
So that

    <kde-plasma/plasma-meta-5.3.50:5

Becomes

    <kde-plasma/plasma-meta-5.3.50:5 **

If you now try an emerge

    emerge -pv kde-plasma/plasma-meta

There will probably be a few packages left over to unmask, copy and paste these into a seperate file

### Install

Next lets to the install
For kde 4 the kde-meta package name would be used, but for plasma we use instead

    emerge kde-plasma/plasma-meta

### Setup Sessions file

After installing everything, I noticed that a single file was missing for startx
/etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

Let's create a new file

    nano -w /etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

Add 2 lines of text to it

    #!/bin/sh
    exec "/usr/bin/startkde"

make it executable

    chmod +x /etc/X11/Sessions/KDE-5

At this point we should now be able to select it via XSESSION=KDE-5 (see below)








### TODO

Tidy up the below:

Another thing to watch out for is that I had to unmask the egl use flag
And enable egl for clutter to get it to build without conflicts

    mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
    echo "-egl" >> /etc/portage/profile/use.mask



## MayNard

Looking at this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/preview-the-upcoming-maynard-desktop/) <br />
In order to get an accelerated desktop ideally we need to use wayland
However the default desktop the rpi uses LXDE doesn't currently support wayland

One option is kde or gnome, but they're a bit heavyweight for the Pi <br />
Raspian has been working on something called Maynard as an alternative for use with Wayland

It looks as if there's an overlay setup for it already under leio

* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard](http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard)

    layman -a leio

Lets install

    emerge wayland
    emerge maynard

In some cases the gles or gles2 use flags are required when wayland is enabled.
Since gles (opengl es) is a subset of opengl designed for embedded systems
I'd recomend only enabling gles / gles2 only on the packages that need it enabled to compile
Otherwise you may get conflicts later on with packages within kde plasma for example


TODO 

 * Missing entry under /etc/X11/Sessions/
 * Maynard requires a background from kde-wallpapers, which does not seem
 * to be even provided anymore. Set the BACKGROUND environment variable
 * to point to a background image that exists, in order to be able to
 * launch Maynard for now.

## Misc

### Default Window Manager

In order to choose the default X window manager we need to edit a file.
For example to set to lxde

    nano -w /etc/env.d/90xsession
    
    XSESSION=lxde

    env-update && source /etc/profile

To get a list of the available values we can put there:

    cd /etc/X11/Sessions/
    ls -l

Then to start up X

    startx

It's important to run env-update and source /etc/profile after changing the value in the file
In order for the default value to be used to change

### XRDP

XRdp is usefull for when we want to connect to the Desktop via rdp from the outside

    make sure server use flag is enabled
    
    emerge --autounmask-write xrdp
    etc-update
    emerge xrdp

TODO Check setup with Wayland etc

### 3D Acceleration

TODO

enable egl / gles / gles1 / gles2 / gles3
disable opengl global

TODO make sure to remerge these:

    net-libs/webkit-gtk
    kde-frameworks/plasma
    kde-plasma/kwin

3D OpenGL ES

 * libEGL.so
 * libGLESv1_CM.so
 * libGLESv2.so
