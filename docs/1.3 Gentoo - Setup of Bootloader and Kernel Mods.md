# 1.3 Gentoo - Setup of Bootloader and Kernel Mods

## Overview

Eventually I'll include my own kernel patchset as part of the overlay <br />
As well as some quick instructions for building / installing your own kernel within gentoo

I've put together some info on the boot process [here](2.1 Boot Process.md) <br />
For now this part of the doc will just focus on re-using the kernel included with raspian for the rpi2

TODO look into custom kernel build

## Mulitple Boot Options

TODO is there any way to have multiple boot options via Noobs? /media/SETTINGS/

## Gentoo Setup

### Exit chroot

In this case since we're already booting into a Raspian install <br />
we should already have a kernel and firmware files setup under /boot (/dev/mmcblk0p5) on the sd card

First exit the chroot

    exit

### Copy Kernel Modules

Next we're going to copy the kernel modules from the raspian setup across to the gentoo root

    cp -a /lib/modules /mnt/gentoo/lib/

### Edit cmdline.txt

Next we're going to setup the /boot/cmdline.txt to tell the kernel to boot the gentoo system instead of raspian <br />
First lets make a backup of the existing file

    cd /boot
    cp cmdline.txt cmdline.txt.raspian

Next we're going to edit the file to change the root option to select a different root partition

Original:

    dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p6 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait

New:

    dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/sda3 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=noop rootwait

Finally make a copy of it

    cp cmdline.txt cmdline.txt.gentoo

Now whenever you want to switch between gentoo and raspian just copy one of those files over the top of cmdline.txt

### Reboot / Unmount into gentoo

Now we should be ready for booting into gentoo <br />
Use the below commands for unmounting the gentoo filesystem / rebooting into gentoo

    umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}
    umount -l /mnt/gentoo{/proc,/boot,/sys,}
    reboot

## Custom Kernel

Typically with raspian the current kenel version as of writing is 3.18.7-v7+ <br />
To get the current kernel version number

    uname -r


There are 2 differences when it comes to the rpi2 vs the rpi kernel

* bcmrpi_defconfig is replaced with bcm2709_defconfig
* The filename for the kernel is kernel7.img isntead of kernel.img
