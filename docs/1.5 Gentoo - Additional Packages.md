# 1.5 Gentoo - Additional Packages

## Overview

I've put a list here of some additional packages I've tried installing

## Overlay

* TODO add package overlay / layman setup

## Rpi Specific

### RPi Userland Tools

Next to install the RPi userland tools

    emerge --autounmask-write  raspberrypi-userland
    etc-update
    emerge raspberrypi-userland

To add the tools to the user path

    nano -w ~/.bashrc

    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/vc/bin

TODO Check compatibility with RPi 2 / more uptodate version via layman, current version fails

### RPi Monitor

TODO try this out http://gpo.zugaina.org/www-apps/rpi-monitor

## Desktop Environment

### LXDE

The default desktop is lxde for the rpi

    emerge lxde-meta

### MayNard

Looking at this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/preview-the-upcoming-maynard-desktop/) <br />
In order to get an accelerated desktop ideally we need to use wayland
However the default desktop the rpi uses LXDE doesn't currently support wayland

One option is kde or gnome, but they're a bit heavyweight for the Pi <br />
Raspian has been working on something called Maynard as an alternative for use with Wayland

TODO can we install Maynard under gentoo?

* http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard

    emerge wayland

### Gnome / KDE

These might be a bit to heavy for the rpi

    emerge kde-meta
    emerge gnome

TODO try installing both of the above for use with mono and Qt

### XRDP

TODO try setting up xrdp

    emerge xrdp


## Misc

### Audio support

As a first step the best approach is to first enable the alsa and oss use flags under gentoo <br />
Enabling both shouldn't hurt, oss used to be depreciated (v3) but there is now a V4 alternative to alsa

* TODO check which the kernel supports oss / alsa
* TODO enable use flags after world rebuild

* http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ALSA
* https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OSS

### Text to Speech

TODO checkout festival / flite, also flite+hts voices

    emerge flite

### Mono

    emerge --autounmask-write mono
    etc-update
    emerge mono
