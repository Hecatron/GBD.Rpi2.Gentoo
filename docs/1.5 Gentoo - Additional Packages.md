# 1.5 Gentoo - Additional Packages

## Overview

I've put a list here of some additional packages I've tried installing

## Layman Overlay

### Initial Setup

Next we're going to setup overlays, via layman.
It's best to check the git use flag is enabled as a starting point.
Next if layman isn't already installed

    emerge layman

Next we need to make sure the overlays are picked up by portage

    echo "source /var/lib/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/portage/make.conf

### Grbd Github Overlay

To add the custom overlay I've setup

    cd /etc/layman/overlays/
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grbd/GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo/master/GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo.xml
    layman -a GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo

* TODO setup custom overlay

This one seems to have rpi-monitor setup

    layman -a srcshelton

### Quick Command Reference

To get the latest version of any overlays that have been setup
(similar to emerge sync)

    layman -S

To list available overlays

    layman --list

To add a new overlay

    layman -a <overlayname>

To remove an overlay

    layman -d <overlayname>

### Custom Overlays

If you want to setup your own overlay on github, one useful tool is

    layman-overlay-maker

However you'll need layman 2.2.0 or later to use if

    emerge --autounmask-write =app-portage/layman-2.3.0

## Rpi Specific

### RPi Userland Tools

Next to install the RPi userland tools

    emerge --autounmask-write  raspberrypi-userland
    etc-update
    emerge raspberrypi-userland

To add the tools to the user path

    nano -w ~/.bashrc

    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/vc/bin

TODO Check compatibility with RPi 2 / more uptodate version via layman, current version fails

### RPi Monitor

TODO try this out http://gpo.zugaina.org/www-apps/rpi-monitor

## Desktop Environment

### LXDE

The default desktop is lxde for the rpi

    emerge lxde-meta

### MayNard

Looking at this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/preview-the-upcoming-maynard-desktop/) <br />
In order to get an accelerated desktop ideally we need to use wayland
However the default desktop the rpi uses LXDE doesn't currently support wayland

One option is kde or gnome, but they're a bit heavyweight for the Pi <br />
Raspian has been working on something called Maynard as an alternative for use with Wayland

TODO can we install Maynard under gentoo?

* http://gpo.zugaina.org/x11-wm/maynard

    emerge wayland

### Gnome / KDE

These might be a bit to heavy for the rpi

    emerge kde-meta
    emerge gnome

TODO try installing both of the above for use with mono and Qt

### XRDP

XRdp is usefull for when we want to connect to the Desktop via rdp from the outside

    make sure server use flag is enabled
    
    emerge --autounmask-write xrdp
    etc-update
    emerge xrdp

TODO Check setup with Wayland etc

## Misc

### Audio support

As a first step the best approach is to first enable the alsa and oss use flags under gentoo <br />
Enabling both shouldn't hurt, oss used to be depreciated (v3) but there is now a V4 alternative to alsa

* TODO check which the kernel supports oss / alsa

* http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ALSA
* https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OSS

### Text to Speech

Lets try text to speech (make sure oss / alsa use flags are enabled)

    emerge flite

TODO check out hts voices

### Mono

To run some .Net apps lets install mono

    emerge --autounmask-write mono
    etc-update
    emerge mono
