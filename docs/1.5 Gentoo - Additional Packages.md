# 1.5 Gentoo - Additional Packages

## Overview

I've put a list here of some additional packages I've tried installing

## Layman Overlay

### Initial Setup

Next we're going to setup overlays, via layman.
It's best to check the git use flag is enabled as a starting point.
Next if layman isn't already installed

    emerge layman

Next we need to make sure the overlays are picked up by portage

    echo "source /var/lib/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/portage/make.conf

### Grbd Github Overlay

To add the custom overlay I've setup

    cd /etc/layman/overlays/
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grbd/GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo/master/GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo.xml
    layman -S
    layman -a GBD-Rpi2-Gentoo

### Quick Command Reference

To get the latest version of any overlays that have been setup
(similar to emerge sync)

    layman -S

To list available overlays

    layman --list

To add a new overlay

    layman -a <overlayname>

To remove an overlay

    layman -d <overlayname>

## Rpi Specific

### RPi Userland Tools

Next to install the RPi userland tools

    emerge --autounmask-write =media-libs/raspberrypi-userland-0_pre20150325
    etc-update
    emerge raspberrypi-userland

### RPI VideoCoreIV

There's also a bunch of libs and binary files as part of the firmware package that is usefull.
This includes edidparser for parsing edid files, and VideoCoreIV for accelerated graphics / accessing the GPU

    emerge --autounmask-write =media-libs/rbpi-videocore-bin-0_pre20150325
    etc-update
    emerge =media-libs/rbpi-videocore-bin-0_pre20150325

It's possible to select a different opengl implementation with eselect

    eselect opengl list
    eselect opengl set

I found that the default xorg implementation needed to be selected in order to get cairo to compile. <br />

TODO the files for VideoCore are installed under /opt/vc/, is there something we need to do for the ebuild
to make eselect aware of it's presence?

### RPi Monitor

TODO currently getting a 400 bad request error
There seems to be problems with the paths in the config file under /etc/
and I think permissions for the web server

    emerge rpi-monitor
    /etc/init.d/rpimonitor start

Go to:

    http://RPI_Ip_Address:8888/

## Misc

### Text to Speech

Lets try text to speech (make sure oss / alsa use flags are enabled)

    emerge flite

Simple test

    flite -t "Hello World"

To list available voices

    flite -lv

Lets try out a new voice

    flite -voice slt -t "Hello World"

TODO are these hts voices?

### Mono

To run some .Net apps lets install mono

    emerge --autounmask-write mono
    etc-update
    emerge mono

### Watchdog

TODO look into [http://pi.gadgetoid.com/article/who-watches-the-watcher](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/article/who-watches-the-watcher)

TODO MonoGame Library / .Net Cross compatibility for a 3D library

### Systemd

Most of the systemd info is already covered here [Link](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Systemd) <br />
This is just info specific to the rpi setup

with the default linux config for the rpi2 I got a warning about CONFIG_DMIID not being set
but so far I've ignored this since it's probably just something related to the arm

* First step

    Make sure mtab is a symbolic link
    ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab

* Enable the systemd use flag, disable the consolekit use flag (I use ufed)
* Update World

    emerge -avDN @world

Note we don't have to use systemd for the boot init process, it's only required as a depend for Gnome.
To use it in place of openrc (the default gentoo init system) we just need to modify the command line parameters passed to the kernel.

TODO list kernel command line parameters / test

### Hardware Random Number Generator

The RPi should have a hardware random number generator (also true for rpi2) <br />
First lets install the tools / load the kernel module into memory

    emerge --autounmask-write rng-utils
    etc-update
    emerge rng-utils
    modprobe bcm2708-rng

Next let's alter a config settings

    nano -w /etc/conf.d/rngd

    RNGD_OPTS="-o /dev/random -r /dev/hwrng"

This initial result should be slow for the random number output

    cat /dev/random

Lets restart rngd

    /etc/init.d/rngd restart

This should now be a lot faster

    cat /dev/random

To add the rngd service to boot

    rc-update add rngd boot
