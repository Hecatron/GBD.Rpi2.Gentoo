# 2.5 Custom Kernel

## Overview

For the default install of gentoo so far I've used the kernel image that comes with raspian.
It turns out there's already an ebuild for the rpi kernel sources under **sys-kernel/raspberrypi-sources**

With the rpi2 there are 2 main differences from the default kernel sources. <br />
Based on this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=101353)

* Instead of bcmrpi_defconfig we use **bcm2709_defconfig**
* The bootloader instead of looking for kernel.img, looks for **kernel7.img** instead

Typically with raspian the current kenel version as of writing is 3.18.7-v7+ <br />
To get the current kernel version number

    uname -r

Kernel sources link:

* [https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/)

## Emerging the sources

I've setup my own overlay under GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo with an ebuild called **sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources**.
It's exactly the same as sys-kernel/raspberrypi-sources except it has a higher version number
and is set for bcm2709_defconfig

Any ebuild ending in 9999 will get the latest version from github, 3.19.1 is one I've set to a particular commit

    emerge --autounmask-write sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources-3.18.1
    etc-update
    emerge =sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources-3.18.1

It'll probably take a while to download since it downloads the whole git tree

We also need the following tools

    emerge --autounmask-write sys-boot/raspberrypi-mkimage
    etc-update
    emerge sys-boot/raspberrypi-mkimage

## Building the Sources

At this stage after the emerge you'll probably find it's installed the sources under
/usr/src/linux-version, with a symbolic link pointing from /usr/src/linux to that directory

When you compile certain apps via emerge, they use the files under the path /usr/src/linux
to act as a basis for the linux sources during compilation (such as additional drivers)

selecting a different kernel that the link needs to point to can be done via eselect kernel

    eselect kernel list
    eselect kernel <id>

To clean the sources

    make mrproper

### Configuring the Kernel

The default configuration for the rpi2 can be setup by doing the following:

    cd /usr/src/linux
    make bcm2709_defconfig

This will output a file **.config** which is the config that will be used for building.
If you want to pull back the config that currently running at present in memory

    zcat /proc/config.gz >/usr/src/linux/config.raspian

To alter config options with a menu

    make menuconfig

The following command can be used to convert a config from an older kernel to the current kernel

    make oldconfig

To compare the old config vs the new

    diff -Naur config.raspian .config >diff1.t

Some thngs I've noticed

* Auditing seems to be enabled on raspian, but disabled for the latest rpi2 kernel default config
that suggests we may get some noticable speed increases by compiling our own kernel

### Building the kernel

To build the kernel and modules using all quad cores

    make -j5

### Installing the kernel

First to install the kernel modules. This should copy the kernel modules
From /usr/src/linux into /lib/modules/kernel-version

    make modules_install

Next to install the kernel image

    cd /usr/src/linux
    cp arch/arm/boot/Image /boot/kernel7-gentoo.img

Note with older bootloaders a script called imagetool-uncompressed.py used to be needed to copy / alter the kernel <br />
However with more recent bootloaders this is no longer required, in fact I found when using Noobs it can actually prevent the kernel from booting altogether.

Lets make a backup of the old raspian kernel

    cd /boot/
    cp kernel7.img kernel7-raspian.img

Finally lets add some new conifg options to config.txt

    nano -w /boot/config.txt

    # Original
    #kernel=kernel7-raspian.img

    # New
    kernel=kernel7-gentoo.img

In the event this doesn't work you can hold down shift at boot, click e to edit configs.
Then comment out the new kernel / uncomment the old kernel file

Finally a reboot

    reboot

### TODO

* TODO try setting up a 2nd boot partition on the SD card that can be selected by Noobs for gentoo
* Look at recompiling Noobs, there's a pull request for usb disk support under [https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs/pulls](https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs/pulls)

* TODO Look into DeviceTree's
* [http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md)
