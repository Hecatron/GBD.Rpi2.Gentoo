# 2.5 Custom Kernel

## Overview

For the default install of gentoo so far I've used the kernel image that comes with raspian.
It turns out there's already an ebuild for the rpi kernel sources under **sys-kernel/raspberrypi-sources**

With the rpi2 there are 2 main differences from the default kernel sources. <br />
Based on this [Link](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=101353)

* Instead of bcmrpi_defconfig we use **bcm2709_defconfig**
* The bootloader instead of looking for kernel.img, looks for **kernel7.img** instead

## Emerging the sources

I've setup my own overlay under GBD.Rpi2.Gentoo with an ebuild called **sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources**.
It's exactly the same as sys-kernel/raspberrypi-sources except it has a higher version number
and is set for bcm2709_defconfig

    emerge --autounmask-write sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources
    etc-update
    emerge sys-kernel/grbdrpi2-sources

It'll probably take a while to download since it downloads the whole git tree

## Building the Sources
