# 2.6 Custom Overlays

## Overview

I've put some info here on creating your own custom overlays

## Overlay Setup

### Userpriv feature

One of the security features enabled by default within portage / emerge, is to always run commands
such as emerge or ebuild as the portage user. If your working on an overlay and it's in a place portage
can't access, this can cause a problem.

One work around to this (although this makes the system a little less secure) is to just turn off the
userpriv feature.

    nano -w /etc/portage/make.conf

    FEATURES="-userpriv"

To see which features are already enabled

    emerge --info | grep ^FEATURES=

### Custom Overlays

If you want to setup your own overlay on github, one useful tool is

    layman-overlay-maker

To generate the xml for layman.
However you'll need layman 2.2.0 or later to use it

    emerge --autounmask-write =app-portage/layman-2.3.0

I'd recommend going back to the default layman version after using layman-overlay-maker.
I had problems with 2.3.0

## Ebuild Setup

### Creating the Digest

The first step is to create a digest / Manifest file for the ebuild, this just acts as a verification
when downloading the source for the emerge that the correct source files have been downloaded

    ebuild <filename>.ebuild digest

The end result should be changes or the addition of a Manifest file
also the sources for the ebuild will be downloaded into /usr/portage/distfiles/
This needs to be done whenever the ebuild file is changed, before it can be used for emerge

### Unpack the Sources

The next stage is to unpack / uncompress the sources

    ebuild <filename>.ebuild unpack

### TODO
