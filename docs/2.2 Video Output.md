# 2.2 Video Output

## Overview

I've put some info here on selecting the default video resolution for an rpi on bootup

Based on this link:

* [http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/getting-your-raspberry-pi-to-output-the-right-resolution](http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/getting-your-raspberry-pi-to-output-the-right-resolution)

### Get EDID Info

First to get the edid information

    tvservice -d edid

This should result in a file being outputed called edid with information pulled from the monitor <br />
The next command will parse that file and show us a list of supported resolutions

    edidparser edid

### Change the boot resolution

Next based on the output from before we're now going to change the default output resolution when the rpi boots

    nano /boot/config.txt

The two options to watch out for are

    hdmi_group=1
    hdmi_mode=16

Note:

* CEA = hdmi_group=1
* DMT = hdmi_group=2

The mode should equal the mode from the line output in edidparser
